            <p>This code of conduct was developed on March 21st 2024. We recognise that these terms may require revision and
                further amendments, which may be changed at a later date.</p>
            <p>The code of conduct is split into three sections, each covering specific aspects of the A.S.T.R.A.L. Institute. The first,
                called "Vision", highlights the basic principles and ethos of A.S.T.R.A.L, from which the other aspects of the code
                of conduct stem from. The second section, titled "Work", outlines work-related practices that A.S.T.R.A.L. members strive
                to uphold and aspire to. This section in particular notes the expectations and responsibilities of students and mentors in
                work-related environments. Finally, the third section, titled "Relationships", draws attention to the relationships between
                members and the relationships between mentors and parents of students to ensure a safe and positive environment for all.
                Below, you can go to any section, or simply continue scrolling to view the full code of conduct.
